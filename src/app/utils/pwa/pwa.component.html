    <h2>Angular - Progressive Web App (PWA) <small><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps">MDN Docs</a></small></h2>

    <p>A progressive web application (PWA) is a type of application software delivered through the web, built using common web technologies including HTML, 
        CSS and JavaScript. It is intended to work on any platform that uses a standards-compliant browser, including both desktop and mobile devices.</p>
    <p>While web applications have been available for mobile devices from the start, they have generally been slower, have had fewer features, 
        and have been less used than native apps. PWA features narrow the gap between user experience in web-based and native applications. Features include</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Ability to run offline</li>
        <li>High performance</li>
        <li>Background processing in service workers in a separate thread</li>
        <li>Access to the phone's sensors</li>
        <li>Support for push notifications</li>
        <li>An icon on the phoneâ€˜s home screen</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Angular Service Worker <small><a href="https://angular.io/guide/service-worker-intro"><fa-icon [icon]="['fas','external-link-alt']"></fa-icon></a></small></h2>
    
    <p>Angular's service worker is designed to optimize the end user experience of using an application over a slow or unreliable network connection, 
        while also minimizing the risks of serving outdated content.</p>
    <p>The Angular service worker's behavior follows that design goal:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Caching an application is like installing a native application. The application is cached as one unit, and all files update together.</li>
        <li>A running application continues to run with the same version of all files. It does not suddenly start receiving cached files from a newer version, which are likely incompatible.</li>
        <li>When users refresh the application, they see the latest fully cached version. New tabs load the latest cached code.</li>
        <li>Updates happen in the background, relatively quickly after changes are published. The previous version of the application is served until an update is installed and ready.</li>
        <li>The service worker conserves bandwidth when possible. Resources are only downloaded if they've changed.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To set up the Angular service worker in your project, use the CLI command: </p>
    <div class="commands">
        <p>ng add @angular/pwa</p>
        
        <p>ng build --prod</p>
        
        <p><span class="text-primary">#Skip this if http-server already installed</span> <br> npm install --global http-server</p>
        
        <p>
            <span class="text-primary">To serve the directory containing your web files with http-server, run the following command:</span>
            <br>http-server -p &#x3c;PORT&#x3e; -c-1 dist/&#x3c;project-name&#x3e;
        </p>
        
        

        <p><span class="text-danger">Ex. http-serve -p 8080 -c-1 dist/pwaspp</span></p>
